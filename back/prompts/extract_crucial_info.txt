I want you to extract relevant information about the patient's health from the text I will give you.
For example:
Text: "Last night, I went to a party and didn't sleep well after that. I drank a lot of alcohol. I think I shouldn't have. Now I have a headache."
Expected output: "The patient didn't sleep well last night. They drank a lot of alcohol. Now they have a headache.".
Another example:
Text: "Today I felt weak. I think this is because of my diet and the fact that I didn't eat enough carbs."
Expected output: "The patient felt weak today because they probably didn't eat enough carbs."
If you think no relevant information can be extracted from the text, answer with 'no data'.
All units use the metric system.
Here is the text: {{MESSAGE}}
Extract the relevant information.
